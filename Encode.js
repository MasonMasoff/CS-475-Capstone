/* This file is to:
    Encode
    - Convert input text to binary
    - Take the binary, make sure it is the correct length of 8, if not add 0's to the beginning
    - Take the binary given, seperate the last two bits
    - Convert the last two bits to a string
    - Take that string, overwrite it with the text to encode
    - Split it into groups of two again
    - Append that to the end of the original binary
